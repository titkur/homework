# homework
1. Used EF Core in memory database for testing and storing data
2. Tried to write a code which is reusable and easy to maintain
3. Since tried to write easily testable code, felt that unit tests it's just a chore at this point. Those easyble added. So didn't write any of those at the moment. Didn't see requirements as well.
4. Code has some flaws and could be improved like everything in programming I guess.
5. Spent ~5-6 hours
